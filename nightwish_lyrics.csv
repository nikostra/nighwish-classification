"(In the sheltering shade of the forest
Calling calming silence
Accompanied only by the full moon
The howling of a night wolf
And the path under my bare feet…
…The Elvenpath)

Hearing music from the deepest forest
Songs as a seduction of sirens
The elf-folk is calling me

Tapio, Bear-king, Ruler of the forest
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the ill and sad
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path

The way to the lands
Where as a hero I stand
The path where Beauty met the Beast
Elvenpath
It’s the honesty of these worlds
Ruled by magic and mighty swords
That makes my soul long for the past
Elvenpath

The moonwitch took me to a ride on a broomstick
Introduced me to her old friend home gnome
Told me to keep the sauna warm for him

At the grove I met the rest - the folk of my fantasies
Bilbo, Sparhawk, goblins and pixies
Snowman, Willow, trolls and the seven dwarves
The path goes forever on

The way to the lands…

As I return to my room
And as sleep takes me by my hand
Madrigals from the woods
Carry me to neverland
In this spellbound night
The world’s an elvish sight
In this spellbound night
The world’s an elvish sight

",Elvenpath,Angels Fall First,1,1,1
"Remember the first dance we shared?
Recall the night you melted my ugliness away?
The night you left with a kiss so kind
Only a scent of beauty left behind

Ah dear friend I remember the night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast

I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls

As a world without a glance
Of the ocean’s fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love for me now has to die
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me

Didn’t you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don’t you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I’ll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?

However cold the wind and rain
I’ll be there to ease your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember beauty is found within

…Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in you…",Beauty And The Beast,Angels Fall First,1,1,1
"Who are you? Man condemned to shine a salvation
Throughout the centuries

Why? Was the wine of the grail
Too sour for man to drink

The carpenter
Carved his anchor
On the dying souls of mankind
On the tomb of this unknown soldier
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died
Tools of the carpenter

The one they lick
The same old sick
Dream of their precious saviour

Kiss them deep
And make them weep
Over promises of eternal peace

The carpenter…

I hear you
Through the symphonic voices of nature
The purity I could never doubt
They tell me to lie on the grass
And observe my saviour
The one crucified to the chirping of birds

The carpenter…",The Carpenter,Angels Fall First,1,1,1
"A nocturnal concerto
Candlelight whispers me where to go
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide
As I wander on this path of the night

Embroidery of the stars
Undress my feelings for this earth
Send me your salva to heal my scars
And let this nakedness be my birth

Macrocosm poured its powers on me
And the hopes of this world I now must leave
The nightwish I sent you centuries ago
Has been heard by those
Who dwelled in a woe

The distance of our bridal bed
Await for me to be dead
Dust of the galaxies take my hand
Lead me to my beloved’s land

Departed by the guillotine of death
I received a letter from the depth
The dream of my lover it carried inside

Caressed by the sharpest knife
I asked you to be my wife
Rays of the setting sun
Were my tears wept upon promises undone

Come to me
Make me believe
to you and your love again

Above the universe
Beneath the Great Eye
I shall desire you forevermore",Astral Romance,Angels Fall First,1,1,1
"An angelface smiles to me
Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth
Farewell - no words to say
Beside the cross on your grave
And those forever burning candles

Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of your time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love tears of fear
Bury my dreams dig up my sorrows
Oh Lord why
The angels fall first?

Not relieved by thoughts of Shangri-La
Nor enlightened by the lessons of Christ
I’ll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light

Needed elsewhere…

Of your kingdom

I swear the heaven’s in my reach

Dancing with the spirit of the air
In this ocean so so open and fair

On my maiden voyage so bold

Landing safely to the blue lagoon

Lies an angel in the snow
The frozen figure crossed by tracks of wolves

With a hungry choir of wolves

Of a sacrament by a campfire

And the one with a tool

I want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar

We will make the streams for our children flow

And wonder if some becoming season
Will make the angel melt in shame

Their satisfaction my infinite sleep

"“I was born amidst the purple waterfalls.
I was weak, yet not unblessed.
Dead to the world. Alive for the journey.
One night I dreamt a white rose withering,
a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness.
I dreamt all my future. Relived my past.
A witnessed the beauty of the beast”

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I’m gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?

I’ve never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There’s a poison drop in this cup of Man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path

“Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time,
soon to be freed from care, from human pain.
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark, silent grave.
Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron,
hope is only an illusion & Ocean Soul’s nothing but a name…

The Child bless thee & keep thee forever”",Bless The Child,Century Child,4,1,1
"It is the end of all hope
To lose the child, the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a birth

No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow

Angels, they fell first but I’m still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung

Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug

Deathwish without a prayer

End of love
End of time

Clouds their waters

Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me

I still feel for you

What should be lost is there

Mother’s mirror, father’s pride

Once again feel the rain
Falling inside me
Cleaning all that I’ve become

My home is far but the rest it lies so close
With my long lost love under the black rose
You told I had the eyes of a wolf
Search them and find the beauty of the beast

Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes

And took a step outside

Once I knew all the tales

Follow the pale moonlight

Faith brought me here
It’s time to cut the rope and fly

The nightingale is still locked in the cage

Sun bathing on its dead frozen leaves

A catnap in the ghost town of my heart
She dreams of storytime and the river ghosts
Of mermaids, of Whitman’s and the Ride
Raving harlequins, gigantic toys

Of a courageous symphony
A verse of me a verse in need
Of a pure-heart singing me to peace

All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

All that great heart lying still
In silent suffering
Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end
What is left for encore
Is the same old Dead Boy’s song
Sung in silence
All that great heart lying still and slowly dying
All that great heart lying still on an angelwing

A princess and a panther by my side
These are Territories I live for
I’d still give my everything to love you more

4. Love

I see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street, with a begging bowl in his shaking hand.
Trying to smile but hurting infinitely. Nobody notices.
I do, but walk by.

An old man gets naked and kisses a model-doll in his attic.
It’s half-light and he’s in tears.
When he finally comes his eyes are cascading.

I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley. He tries to bite me.
All pride has left his wild drooling eyes.
I wish I had my leg to spare.

A mother visits her son, smiles to him through the bars.
She’s never loved him more.

An obese girl enters an elevator with me.
All dressed up fancy, a green butterfly on her neck.
Terribly sweet perfume deafens me.
She’s going to dinner alone.
That makes her even more beautiful.

I see a model’s face on a brick wall.
A statue of porcelain perfection beside a violent city kill.
A city that worships flesh.

The 1st thing I ever heard was a wandering man telling his story
It was you, the grass under my bare feet
The campfire in the dead of the night
The heavenly black of sky and sea

It was us
Roaming the rainy roads, combing the gilded beaches
Waking up to a new gallery of wonders every morn
Bathing in places no-one’s seen before
Shipwrecked on some matt-painted island
Clad in nothing but the surf - beauty’s finest robe

Beyond all mortality we are, swinging in the breath of nature
In early air of the dawn of life
A sight to silence the heavens

I want to travel where life travels, following its permanent lead
Where the air tastes like snow music
Where grass smells like fresh-born Eden
I would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or rapture
I would bathe in a world of sensation
Love, Goodness, and Simplicity
( While violated and imprisoned by technology )

The thought of my family’s graves was the only moment I used to experience true love
That love remains infinite, as I’ll never be the man my father is

How can you “just be yourself” when you don’t know who you are?
Stop saying “I know how you feel”
How could anyone know how another feels?

Who am I to judge a priest, beggar, whore, politician, wrongdoer?
I am, you are, all of them already

Dear child, stop working, go play
Forget every rule
There’s no fear in a dream

“Is there a village inside this snowflake?”

a child asked me “What’s the color of our lullaby?”
I’ve never been so close to truth as then
I touched its silver lining

Nothing noble in dying for your religion
For your country
For ideology, for faith

Ink idle without a poem

Without love and disarming beauty

Careless realism costs souls

Ever seen the Lord smile?
All the care for the world made Beautiful a sad man?
Why do we still carry a device of torture around our necks?
Oh, how rotten your pre-apocalypse is
All you bible-black fools living over nightmare ground

I see all those empty cradles and wonder

The sound of mist, smell of moss-grown woods Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher
Into the wild
Weaving my world into tapestry of life
Its fire golden In my Walden I will taste the manna in every tree
Liquid honey and wine from the distant hills
An early morning greenwood concerto
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice I do not wish to evade the world
Yet I will forever build my own
Forever build my own
Forever my home",My Walden,Endless Forms Most Beautiful,8,3,2
"Come on, hop on, let’s take a ride
Come and meet the travelers who came to town
They have a tale from the past to tell
From the great dark between the stars

We are a special speck of dust
A fleeting moment on an ark
A celebration, A resthaven
Of life

Lay on a field of green
With mother Eve
With father pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous

Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful

Beyond aeons we take a ride
Welcoming the shrew that survived
To see the Tiktaalik take her first walk
Witness the birth of flight

Deeper down in Panthalassa
A eukaryote finds her way
We return to the very first one
Greet the one we’ll soon become",Endless Forms Most Beautiful,Endless Forms Most Beautiful,8,3,2
"One by one we light the candles of this show
One by one, enter the theatre of the primal birth
Silently watch the planetary curtain go down
Laugh and rejoice, as the powerful play greets you tonight

We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us dream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home

We’ll give you a key to open all of the gates
We’ll show you a sea of starlight to drown all your cares
Mirrorhouses, the sweetest kisses and wines
A Debussy dialogue between wind and the roaring sea

Dance to the whistle, to the play, to the story
To infinite encores
Laugh at the royalty with sad crowns
And repeat the chorus once more",Edema Ruh,Endless Forms Most Beautiful,8,3,2
"Once upon a time a song was heard
Giving birth to a child of earth and verse

Together we slay another fright
Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see

We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the Music, one with alpenglow

Hand in hand guiding me into light
You, the fairytale guise in blue and white

You are my path my home my star
A beautiful tale within the tale
And when the dust needs to move on
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow
Painting white, silencing the valley we built
Together we’ll sleep
Devoured by Life",Alpenglow,Endless Forms Most Beautiful,8,3,2
"1.) Four Point Six
Archaean horizon
The first sunrise
On a pristine Gaea
Opus perfectum
Somewhere there, us sleeping

2.) Life
The cosmic law of gravity
Pulled the newborns around a fire
A careless, cold infinity in every vast direction
Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone

From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast
Enter LUCA

The tapestry of chemistry
There’s a writing in the garden
Leading us to the Mother of all

We are one
We are a universe
Forbears of what will be
Scions of the Devonian sea
Aeons pass
Writing the tale of us all

For the greatest show on Earth

To the stuff of stars
Bedding the tree of a biological holy

Of every form most beautiful

Out of Africa
Little Lucy of the Afar

To idolatry
To self-destructive weaponry

Deep within the past
Atavistic dread of the hunted

Enter Ionia, the cradle of thought
The architecture of understanding
The human lust to feel so exceptional
To rule the Earth

For giant mushroom clouds

Enter history, the grand finale

Had a dream to understand
A single grain of sand
He gave birth to poetry
But one day’ll cease to be

"Before you
My home was in the wind and surf
The birds and rain, voices of the northern lights

Then you came
I joined you beyond the aeons
As you blew your cave bear bone
And began to hum

Eradicate the torment of a heavy heart
Emancipate the deaf
Sing the graceful third part

Then orchestrate an air for only you to sing
Caress it deep
It`s always there to unlock the stars
To enter


Music
Fanning the flames of a mystery
Deepening the listening
Losing
Yourself to the endless symphony
Of now

Singing the tale of another man
Have you ever heard
Music
It is coming, coming, coming your way
The very first song


You want to dream?
Want a tale in major scale?
Wish to leave the hollow, to dance with Pan?

Can you hear the brave drum from the moors?
Follow the beat
And leave the noise behind if we be lovers

Performance starts, come join the gathering
And you will leave with a wildflower aftertaste

Become the kind who still laughs at butterflies
Give me a home inside you until the final
Thank you and a good night

In here, I am the silence of sound
Curing the common show
For the steady song
There, I`ll greet the greedy crowd
But will never, ever sing to them

Tick-tock, time stops
Follow me into the fog
To the hilltop
Follow the call sky-clad
Evoke the Hum
Allure the sirens

Time and silence",Music,Human. :||: Nature.,9,3,2
"Crave the machine
Revere the screen
Zoom in for flak and misery
Bleed some pixels

Pose for the dead

In a hot air matrix

Feeding the beast
In your loud Egoland

You have become
Tool of a tool

Telling you to
Shut up and dance!

Color a yarn and the crowds will gather

Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice

Endless noise

Please love me
See how I bleed
Please endure
I have such empathy in me

Hum, noise, hum
Beautifully numb
Tapping the quiet air
To have a meaning

By a carrion
Sad hologram
Lost in the maze
The real and human feel

Sunset is free
From this deity

For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons
Story unheard
Howling at the Earth
Yours the whole graveyard of heavens

Singing through the morn for mankind
I want to sing with you
You`re home now, outward urge
As with every dreaming creature
We want to come with you

Here I came to be
Your reach into the far
On the stellar sea
Cut in little stars

We all wait the due night
Beauty which is worth the hurting
We`re coming to join you
Hope revived for a lifetime
To rekindle the human spark
In love with the night

Now you`ve been tucked in
For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons
Story now heard
Howling at the Earth
Yours is the whole starmap of heavens
Of myriad endings

A waypoint to the far
On the stellar sea
Cut into little
Stars calling with the sound
Of a dreamlike dulcimer
We came here to stay
With your guiding light


“And when he shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine

"My harvest will come
A tiny valorous straw
Among the millions
Facing to the sun
I will pause before a man
Whose path has just begun
Something unsung our way comes

The quaternary code
Gave mankind a rose
So we could see the beautiful die
The strange peace of storm
Hovers over crops
And a child's face aglow before the scythe

Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth

They have beauty beyond all poetry
But choose a silent misery
The deeper their sea, the less remains
They'll find the pretty words
And tame flocks to herd
There's that, or a carousal of dare

Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
Arrive alive",Harvest,Human. :||: Nature.,9,3,2
"Once there was a silent canvas
Sleeping stories unimagined
Birth of what if`s, hope and wonder
Winds will be named, words will shelter

Then, something wicked their way came

To Keystone Earth
To fallen stars

Shared a story, took the leap
Rose up rooted, hid a note

You`ve been there

A child of light, another tale

Night will come but not to stay
Why?

Fly towards the calm
Fly utterly lost
Towards a beating heart

Underneath the silence?

We are, we were, and will not be

Will have a visit, as along came heartbeat

The living lie, dead afraid
Then they saw the moon, and found caring

Such worlds were there, zoos dead again
After all, we should`ve never appeared
Spaceship Earth, through the fields of time
